# Cache-Controller-Implementation-with-Write-Through-Policy
Cache Controller Implementation with Write-Through Policy using verilog.
## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- Implement a cache system integrated with a RISC-V processor.
- Focus on caching data memory only, with one level of caching.
- Use a cache geometry of (512, 16, 1) with a direct mapping policy.
- Implement write-through and write-around policies for write hit and write miss.
- Ensure proper handling of read and write operations with stall signals.
